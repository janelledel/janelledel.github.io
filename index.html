<u>Early Age/Childhood</u><br>
Hello, my name is Janelle Marie DelCastillo. I was born on December 8th, 2003 in Hoboken, New Jersey. I grew up and currently live in <a href="https://www.lyndhurstnj.org/">Lyndhurst, New Jersey</a>. It's a small town in Bergen County that is gradually increasing with around 22,500 residents. I live with my mother and father whose names are Michelle Crespo and Johnny DelCastillo. My parents had decided to combine their names together to create my name. I am the youngest of three with around a 17-year age gap, as my two half-sisters are both in their 30s. The eldest sister is named Nicole, and the second eldest is named Jennifer. Growing up, I didn't have much in common due to the age gap but are now closer than when I was a child.

<u>Favorite Hobbies</u><br>
My favorite hobbies would be swimming, and arts & crafts. From second grade until senior year of high school, I was competitively swimming for the <a href="https://www.gomotionapp.com/team/njscar/page/home">Scarlet Aquatics</a> formerly known as Skyy Swim Team. It was a way that allowed me to make more friends and work on my fitness and health, Swimming is something that I greatly enjoy.
<br>As far as I can remember, I have always enjoyed art. It has been something that brings me closer to my mom as she raised me with creativity and a passion for art. Whether it was painting, drawing, or sculpting, my mom and I were always doing a different type of art project.

<u> Major: Marine Biolgy</u><br>
I'm majoring in Marine Biology, as it's something that I see myself excited to do in the future. I enjoy being out on the beaches and, on boats out in the ocean. Over the summer, I worked for <a href="https://njseagrant.org/">NJ Sea Grant Consortium</a> at Sandy Hook as a field guide instructor. I was able to study fishes and mollusks, and the environment at the salt marshes. It was a great experience for me and I would like to do it again.
